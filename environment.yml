channels:
  - pytorch         # Official PyTorch channel (CPU/GPU versions)
  - conda-forge     # Broad, community-maintained packages â€” more up-to-date and portable
  - defaults        # Official Anaconda channel (fallback)

dependencies:
  # Python version (older 3.8 version = broader compatibility, but you could bump to 3.10+ if needed)
  - python=3.8      

  # Core numerical and scientific stack
  - numpy           # Fast numerical arrays, cross-platform
  - pandas          # DataFrames and tabular data
  - scikit-learn    # Classical ML models
  - matplotlib      # Plotting
  - scikit-image    # Image processing
  - tifffile        # Reading TIFF images (often needed for satellite imagery)

  # Geospatial / satellite data
  - rasterio        # Geospatial raster I/O; can be finicky on Windows if pinned too tightly
  - shapely         # Geometry objects and spatial operations

  # Usability / speed
  - tqdm            # Progress bars in loops

  # Data augmentation
  - albumentations  # Advanced image augmentation (version pinned to avoid breaking changes)

  # PyTorch stack (ðŸ§  ML backbone)
  - pytorch         # CPU version will be installed automatically unless CUDA is available
  - torchvision    # Models and image preprocessing for PyTorch

  # Model training & utilities
  - pytorch-lightning     # High-level wrapper for PyTorch training loops
  - segmentation-models-pytorch=0.3.4  # Predefined semantic segmentation models using PyTorch
  - timm             # PyTorch image models (transformers, convnets, etc.)
  - tensorboard            # Visualization for training logs

  # Ensures pip is available for pip-only installs below
  - pip                   

  # Packages not available on conda (install via pip)
  - pip:
      # - albucore            # Not on conda, related to albumentations config/metadata
      # - annotated-types      # Typing support, required by some ML libs
      # - astunparse==1.6.3           # Parses and un-parses Python ASTs (used by TensorFlow and similar frameworks)
